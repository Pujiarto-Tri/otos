Alias template: delegate category test rendering to the canonical
`students/tryouts/package_test_question.html`. This keeps one source
of truth for both package and single-category test UIs.

{% extends 'students/tryouts/package_test_question.html' %}


{# Deprecated alias. Actual template moved to students/tryouts/package_test_question.html #}
{% include 'students/tryouts/package_test_question.html' %}
